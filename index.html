                <p>My name is Jennifer but I like to go by JJ. I am a Data Analyst at the UC Davis
                    Utilities Department where I have been working for the last 10 years. However, I have been
                    working on campus in various positions since October 2002. At this point in my career, I
                    need to pursue outside education to continue to advance. Coding is a field with infinite
                    possibilities as it pertains to all industries. While I have limited web development skills
                    at this time, I look forward to acquiring the technical expertise that will open up new
                    career paths. One of several highly appealing aspects of web development is the potential for
                    working remotely. With traffic getting worse all the time and volatile gas prices, I love
                    the idea of avoiding a daily commute. </p>
                <p>On a personal note, I am obsessed with the television show <em>The Great British Bake Off</em>,
                    which as you probably guessed, is a baking competition. I don't usually care for the
                    personal drama encouraged on most reality TV shows. However, this series is filmed in
                    Britain, and they seem to promote a kinder, more respectful approach. The contestants may
                    cry because the judges were a little harsh or their bake didn't turn out well, but it's
                    never because they were mean to each other. After purchasing one of the cookbooks inspired
                    by the show, I have had varying degrees of success and generally foist the results on my
                    co-workers who have been happy to eat the bakes and give me feedback. Now I just need
                    to find a balance between baking and exercise!</p>
